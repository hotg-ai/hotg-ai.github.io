## Hammer Of The Gods (HOTG)

Making Every Edge Smarter

### Where is the world going?
- Sensors generate more data than we capture or use
- 5G will bring low latency and high bandwidth leading to higher density of edge devices
- Computations will move to the edge, and federate back intelligence
- Billions of edge devices to be launched over next few years

### What are we solving?
Making it really easy to develop, deploy, and manage apps and models (tinyML apps) on constrained devices

## Products

### Rune
Containers for tinyML apps and models. Build tinyML apps in a reliable and consistent way

### Hammer
Deploy and manage production tinyML apps

### Anvil
Target multiple devices and device types using configuration instead of code

### Saga
Run and scale production systems of tinyML apps with resiliency, observability, and data management

## The future

Build and package tinyML apps as **_Rune_** containers, to target any device environment using **_Anvil_** configurations, and deploy them using **_Hammer_** on to a meshed network of devices with **_Saga_**

## Will it be open source?
Yes!
